# verasure - Jerasure made simple in V

This is a V implementation of Jerasure2, with a custom wrapper. In V, there is a wrapper to make
call pure-v style.

# Example
```v
import verasure

e := verasure.new(16, 4)
shards := e.encode("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer consectetur accumsan augue, at pharetra".bytes())
println(shards)

data := e.decode(shards)
println(data.bytestr())
```

1. Create a new Verasure object, with data and parity amount
2. Encode any bytes data
3. Decode shards to get bytes back

# Disclamer

This is still in progress, memory management is not yet there. There is still a bug on parity missing.
